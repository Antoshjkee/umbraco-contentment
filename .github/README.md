## Umbraco Contentment

> contentment /kənˈtɛntm(ə)nt/ - a shoebox of happiness and satisfaction

### What is it?

This is a collection of Umbraco components that I have developed for use on my own **Umbraco v8** implementation projects.

Some components may be innovative, others may be reimagining of existing components, property-editors, features and other community packages.


#### Why should I use it?

I'm sharing my code with the world. It is your choice (and responsibility) whether you would like to use it. No pressure from me.


#### What's on offer?

Let's open the shoebox and take a look inside...

##### Property Editors

- [Bytes](../docs/editors/bytes.md)
- [Data List](../docs/editors/data-list.md)
- [Icon Picker](../docs/editors/icon-picker.md)
- [Notes](../docs/editors/notes.md)
- [Render Macro](../docs/editors/render-macro.md)

There is documentation for each of the property-editors, with screenshots, use-cases and code examples.


### Documentation

[Documentation for each of the components can be found in the /docs folder](../docs/).


#### Known issues

_There are currently no known issues with the Contentment package._
