## Umbraco Contentment

> contentment /kənˈtɛntm(ə)nt/ - a shoebox of happiness and satisfaction

### What is it?

This is a collection of Umbraco components that I have developed for use on my own Umbraco v8 implementation projects.

Some components may be innovative, others may be a reimagining of existing components, data-editors, features and other community packages.


#### What's on offer?

Let's open the shoebox and take a look inside...

##### Data Editors

_What the heck is a Data Editor?_

> Data Editors is the Umbraco v8 term for combining what was previously called **Property Editors** and **Parameter Editors** in Umbraco v6/v7.
> The difference between the two are that Property Editors can be configured (using a Data Type) and Parameter Editors have a default (or zero) configuration.

###### Property Editors

- [Checkbox](../docs/data-editors/checkbox.md)
- Checkbox List
- Code Editor (ACE)
- Configuration Editor
- Data List
- Data Table
- [Dropdown](../docs/data-editors/dropdown.md)
- [Macro Picker](../docs/data-editors/macro-picker.md)
- [Notes](../docs/data-editors/notes.md)
- Radio Button List
- [Render Macro](../docs/data-editors/render-macro.md)
- [Umbraco Entity Picker](../docs/data-editors/umb-entity-picker.md)

All of these can be configured to be used as Parameter Editors.
