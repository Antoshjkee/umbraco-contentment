## Umbraco Contentment

> contentment /kənˈtɛntm(ə)nt/ - a shoebox of happiness and satisfaction

### What is it?

This is a collection of Umbraco components that I have developed for use on my own **Umbraco v8** implementation projects.

Some components may be innovative, others may be reimagining of existing components, property-editors, features and other community packages.


#### Why should I use it?

I'm sharing my code with the world. It is your choice (and responsibility) whether you would like to use it. No pressure or marketing spin from me.


#### What's on offer?

Let's open the shoebox and take a look inside...

##### Property Editors

- [Bytes](../docs/editors/bytes.md)
- [Data List](../docs/editors/data-list.md)
- [Icon Picker](../docs/editors/icon-picker.md)
- [Notes](../docs/editors/notes.md)
- [Render Macro](../docs/editors/render-macro.md)

#### Documentation

[Documentation for each of the components - with screenshots, use-cases and code examples - can be found in the /docs folder](../docs/).

Please note, you may find other components within Contentment that haven't yet been documented. _Let's call those "undocumented features"._


#### Release status

My aim to have a v1.0 beta release ready by the **end of Q3 (September) 2019**.

Downloads will be made available, (in due course), on the [releases page](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/releases).


#### Known issues

_There are currently no known issues with the Contentment package._


### Support

In terms of licensing and support, from my past experience, soul searching and burnout! I am taking a subtler approach - no implementation support, no bug reports, no feature requests.

With one exception, **Pull Requests will be warmly embraced!** I want to welcome and encourage code collaborations.
If you find a bug, fix it, send me a patch. Got an idea for a new feature, open a pull request (with or without code) and we can discuss.
Show some willing and I will be your best friend.

_"But I'm not a coder, I need support!"_ I hear you cry. Then hopefully someone can help you on the Our Umbraco support forum.
_"But I already work 70 hours a week, I need these bugs fixing ASAP!"_ Ah, time vs money.

I am not unempathetic to your needs, but also I am not your support developer.
The Umbraco community is amongst the friendliest on our planet. Ask for help on the Our Umbraco support forum, hopefully someone can help you there.

If you don't like this, then I would advise not to use this package. I am not forcing you to do so.

I have enjoyed developing these editors, I have enjoyed sharing my code with the world, I have not enjoyed being a free support developer.
