## Umbraco Contentment

> contentment /kənˈtɛntm(ə)nt/ - a state of happiness and satisfaction

This is a collection of Umbraco components that I use on my own Umbraco v8 implementation projects.

Some data-editors may be innovative, others may be a reimagining of existing data-editors, features and community packages.

#### What's on offer?

##### Data Editors

> Data Editors appear to be the new v8 term for combining what was previously v6/v7 Property Editors and Parameter Editors.
> These can be used as either Property Editors or Parameter Editors.

###### Property Editors (all of these can be configured to be used as Parameter Editors)

- Checkbox
- Dropdown
- Entity Picker
- Macro Picker
- Notes
- Render Macro

###### Configuration Editors (formerly known as Parameter Editors)

- Data Table
