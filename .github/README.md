## Umbraco Contentment

> contentment /kənˈtɛntm(ə)nt/ - a shoebox of happiness and satisfaction

### What is it?

This is a collection of Umbraco components that I have developed for use on my own **Umbraco v8** implementation projects.

Some components may be innovative, others may be a reimagining of existing components, property-editors, features and other community packages.


#### Why should I use it?

I'm sharing my code with the world. It is your choice (and responsibility) whether you would like to use it.
No pressure or marketing spin from me.


#### What's on offer?

Let's open the shoebox and take a look inside...

##### Property Editors

- [Bytes](../docs/editors/bytes.md)
- [Data List](../docs/editors/data-list.md)
- [Icon Picker](../docs/editors/icon-picker.md)
- [Notes](../docs/editors/notes.md)
- [Render Macro](../docs/editors/render-macro.md)


#### Release status

My aim to have a v1.0 beta release ready by the **end of Q3 (September) 2019**.

Downloads will be made available, (in due course), on the [releases page](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/releases).


#### Known issues

_There are currently no known issues with the Contentment package._


### Documentation

[Documentation for each of the components - with screenshots, use-cases and code examples - can be found in the /docs folder](../docs/).

Please note, you may find other components within Contentment that haven't yet been documented.
_Let's call those "undocumented features"._


### Support

In terms of licensing and support, from past experience and having suffered my fair share of burnout! I am reluctant to offer any support.

I developed this project for use in my own Umbraco implementations. I enjoy developing these editors, and I enjoy sharing my code with you. I have not enjoyed being a free support developer.

If you decide to use Contentment in your own Umbraco implementations, that is brilliant. I'd love to hear about it.
**Any feedback you have will be warmly embraced!** _...and if you send me a Pull Request, I'll be your best friend!_

I can not offer this project with warranty for bug fixes. Particularly if it is used in unconventional ways. _(e.g. using a Data List inside a Nested Content, inside a Grid editor, inside a multi-lingual Variant.)_

While I can not offer any warranty for bus fixes, if you do report a bug, I reserve the right to address it in my own time, or ignore it completely.

I appreciate that not everyone is a coder, or that some folk are working over 70 hours a week and need bugs fixing ASAP!
I am not unempathetic to your needs, but I am not your support developer.

You should embrace the Umbraco community, it is amongst the friendliest on our planet. Ask for help on the Our Umbraco support forum, hopefully someone can help you there.
