# Contentment Ideas

## Data Editors

- Configuration Settings
  A property-editor that wraps another editor to add a cog icon in the top-right, which would open an overlay with configuration settings.
  Think Vorto, but for extra options.

- Hide Label
  A property-editor wrapper that can add a "Hide Label" field. Apart from that, everything else is an invisible wrapper.

- Textbox
  Customizable textbox, Placeholder text, Default value, Prefix / suffix (input groups), Char limit, Hide label, Html5 types, Data list

- Remote Content
  Enter a URL into a textbox, the value-converter will request the URL, cache and return its contents as the property value.

- Local Content
  Enable editing of a local file's content, e.g. robots.txt
  Something similar to this, https://our.umbraco.com/packages/website-utilities/umbraco-content-files/, but not as tied to the doctype.
